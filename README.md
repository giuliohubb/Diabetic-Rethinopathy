# retinopathy-dataset
A curated version of the dataset used while developing the diabetic-retinopathy-screening project. 

This repository does not contain all of the images used while creating the diabetic-retinopathy-screening project. As such, please note that the predetermined file lists in the "logs/" directory of the project may include files that are not available with this dataset. 

The full dataset is hosted here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data. Only the "train_00x.zip" files were used. In order to use the full dataset, all of the training zip files must be downloaded and extracted together.
